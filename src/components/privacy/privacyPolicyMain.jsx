<p className="terms-para">This Cookie Policy explains how NobleSets (“we”, “us”, or “our”) uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website [___________] or mobile application (“Services”). It explains what these technologies are, why we use them, and your rights to control our use of them.</p>

  <li>
    DOES NOBLESETS USE COOKIES?
    <p className="terms-para">NobleSet uses cookies, tags and other technologies when you use any of the NobleSet websites, mobile sites or mobile apps (collectively "the services"). Cookies are used to ensure everyone has their best possible experience. Cookies also help us keep your account safe. By continuing to visit or use our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes we describe in this policy. If you prefer not to receive cookies or web beacons, then you should stop using our site, or consult your browsing and third party cookie settings as described below.</p>

  </li>
  <li>WHAT IS A COOKIE?
    <p className="terms-para">Cookies are small pieces of text stored by a website you visit in your browser and subsequently sent by your web browser in every request to the website. A cookie file is stored in your web browser and allows the Site or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the Site more useful to you. Essentially, cookies are a user’s identification card for the NobleSet servers. Cookies allow NobleSet to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience on our site. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used in the Websites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may analyse or perform analysis based on the use of these technologies and generate reports on an individual and aggregated basis.</p>
     <p className="terms-para">Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to NobleSet or interact with our services without signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by NobleSet when you return to one of our sites or a partner site that uses our services. Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).</p>
  </li>
